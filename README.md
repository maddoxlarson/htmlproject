# htmlproject
A project that I am working on to increase my skills with HTML, CSS, and SCSS. 

Notice that I am not a master at HTML5 or CSS, this project is made to get 
better as my fluency increases.

Atom is the recommended text editor, thought it does not need to be used in order
to be successful.

Within Atom you may install a package called 'atom-beautify', this package all-
ows you to properly indent all of your code with the simple tap of a button.

Sincerely,
      Maddox L.
